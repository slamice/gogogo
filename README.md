# gogogo

I wanted to learn Go since it seemed cool. So I picked up a few books to learn it. Here are some books about Go:

I realized while reading these that from the beginning they end up reading like a Reference book. You start with learning about syntax, numbers, formatting, etc., and slowly build on that.

That's not really what happens though. You want to think about what to make, slowly make it, gradually taking parts apart, optimizing it, etc. The best way to learn is to build something.

This project is about building a WebApp with Go as the backend. We'll be making mistakes along the way and corrcting them as we *go* (sorry). I'll attempt to document in depth all the decisions I make while building this app.

Ideas on where to begin:
1. TDD start with tests, learn how to write them
2. Picking a web framework
- Why do we pick one, as opposed to using Go's
- Advantages with the one we picked
3. Building a backend (API based), CRUDing a user

...

Building middleware
